## Here is a breakdown of what the s3-bucket modules configuration aims to achieve. 

### resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website_bucket":
This resource creates the main S3 bucket. It uses the name provided in `var.bucket_name`. The `force_destroy` option is set to true, allowing the bucket to be deleted even if it contains objects. This can be useful for testing but should be used cautiously in production. I also added tags to identify the bucket's purpose and environment.

### locals { bucket_regional_domain_name }:
This local value constructs the regional domain name for the S3 bucket. It's not a resource, but it's used to create a standardized URL for the bucket that includes the AWS region.

### resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "website_config":
This resource configures the S3 bucket for static website hosting. It specifies `"index.html"` as the default page (shown when someone visits the root of your website) and `"error.html"` as the error page (displayed when an error occurs, like a 404 Not Found).

### resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning_config":
This resource enables versioning on the S3 bucket. Versioning keeps multiple variants of objects in the bucket, allowing you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object. This is useful for data protection and recovery.

### resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "public_access":
This resource sets up a public access block on the bucket, effectively preventing any public access. All four types of public access are blocked. This is a crucial security measure, ensuring that your bucket contents are not accidentally exposed to the public internet.

### resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "website":
This resource configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the bucket. It allows resources on our website to be requested from other domains. This configuration permits GET and HEAD requests from any origin, which is quite permissive and might need to be tightened based on our specific needs.

### resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html":
This resource uploads the index.html file to your S3 bucket. It sets the content type to "text/html" so that when served, browsers will interpret it correctly as an HTML file.

### resource "aws_s3_object" "website_files":
This resource is more complex. It uses a `for_each loop` to upload all files from the website directory to the S3 bucket. It automatically sets the correct content type for each file based on its extension, ensuring that when these files are served, browsers will handle them correctly. This is crucial for proper functioning of the website, as it ensures CSS files are treated as CSS, JavaScript as JavaScript, images as their respective formats, and so on.
