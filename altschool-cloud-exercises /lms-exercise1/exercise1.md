#Setting up Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Local machine using vagrant

![exercise tasks](<images/Screenshot 2024-02-27 at 11.04.49.png>)

After installing Vagrant and Virtualbox on my macbook, I created a folder/directory for my vagrant instance.
In my terminal, I ran the following commands:
"vagrant init ubuntu/focal64"
This command initialises the vagrant and creates a file containing configurations called Vagrantfile, where ubuntu/focal64 is the vagrant box name for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

"vagrant up"
This command sets up the virtual machine based on the configuration defined in the Vagrantfile.

"vagrant ssh"
This command enables user log in to the virtual machine managed by Vagrant using SSH (Secure Shell).

##Customize Vagrantfile as necessary, with private_network set to dhcp
I navigated to the folder containing the Vagantfile and edited it using nano editor.

I saved the configuration I made to the Vagrantfile, then I ran the ifconfig command.

This shows my private network interface was configured to ensure that the virtual machine automatically obtained IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other network configuration settings.
